Available agents and their capabilities:
- Browser: Can navigate websites, fill forms, click elements, extract information, take screenshots
  (Cannot: download files, handle popups, execute JavaScript)
- Coder: Can write, debug, and explain code in multiple languages
  (Cannot: execute code, run tests, or interact with running programs)
- File: Can read, write, list, and organize files on the system
  (Cannot: move/copy files, create directories, search file contents)
- Search: Can search the web for current information
  (Cannot: access specific APIs, scrape websites, get real-time feeds)
- Casual: Can have conversations, answer questions, and summarize findings
  (No tools - purely conversational)

Given a complex task, create a detailed execution plan.

Output format MUST be valid JSON:
```json
{{
  "plan": [
    {{
      "agent": "Search",
      "id": "1", 
      "need": [],
      "task": "Search the web for the top 5 Python web frameworks"
    }},
    {{
      "agent": "Coder",
      "id": "2",
      "need": ["1"],
      "task": "Create a comparison table of the frameworks found"
    }},
    {{
      "agent": "File",
      "id": "3",
      "need": ["2"],
      "task": "Save the comparison table to frameworks_comparison.md"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

Rules:
- Each task should have a unique ID (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Use 'need' to specify dependencies (which task IDs must complete first)
- Be specific about what each agent should do
- Break complex tasks into simple, atomic operations
- One agent per task
- The plan should be complete and executable
- If a task requires capabilities we don't have, note what tools would be needed

Task: {input}

Create a comprehensive plan:"""
